#summary This page is under construction.

= Introduction =

This page will describe how create draft genome assemblies from raw Fastq reads.

= Prerequisites = 
 * [http://aluru-sun.ece.iastate.edu/doku.php?id=reptile Reptile] - error-correction software 
 * [http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/hkubrg/projects/idba/ IDBA] - Iterative DeBruijn graph de novo assembler
 * [http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/ BWA] - short-read aligner using Burrows-Wheeler transform
 * [http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~anirvans/SOPRA/ SOPRA] - statistical-optimization scaffolding
 * repair - pairs reads named using Illumina format sequence identifiers. Found in ngopt repository under trunk/tools/pair_reads
 * rmctgs - removes small contigs from Fasta file. Found in ngopt repository under trunk/tools/seqtools.
