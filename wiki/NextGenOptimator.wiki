#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

NextGenOptimator is a a project dedicated to developing tools for the analysis of output from genome sequencing and assembly pipelines. High demands for low-cost sequencing have resulted in the development of a few new DNA sequencing technologies and a plethora of software packages for analyzing and assembling sequencing output, resulting a wide variety of potential strategies for _de novo_ sequencing. The goal of this project is to develop software to assess the many possible strategies for genome sequencing, and provide a way of choosing an optimal strategy for _de novo_ sequencing.

= Details =

Rather than scoring assembler pipelines alone, we focus on scoring sequencer+assembler performance.
