#summary A tutorial for assembling paired short reads generated on the Illumina platform

= Introduction =

Assembling genomes if fun


= Software Requirements = 
  * Java - Most computers already have Java installed.
  * Perl - Most computers already have Perl installed.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/ngopt/downloads/detail?name=ngopt_a5pipeline_linux-x86_64.tar.gz&can=2&q=#makechanges NGOpt pipeline]

= Data Requirements = 
  * One or more paired-end dataset in FastQ format in Illumina 1.3+ format
    * Single-end datasets may be included in addition to paired-end datasets

= Assembling FastQ files = 
== Making Configuration File ==
The NGOpt pipeline takes two base arguments: an output basename, and a library file. The library file tells NGOptA5 where the FastQ files are. Although it is not necessary, insert size estimates for paired libraries can be supplied in the configuration file. This estimate is used when assemblies are too poor to reliably estimate insert sizes.
