#summary A simple example of preprocessing of multiplexed Illumina.

= Introduction =
This page will describe how to preprocess custom-barcode multiplexed Illumina data. 
= Prerequisites = 
You will need the following software in your executable path.
 * [http://genome.gsc.riken.jp/osc/english/dataresource/ Tagdust] - eliminate artifactual sequence from NGS data
 * [http://code.google.com/p/ngopt/source/browse/trunk/tools/splitbc/splitBC?r=70 splitBC] - a script to split barcoded reads. 

= Preprocess Multiplexed Data =
== Remove artifactual DNA ==
Often times during library preparations, DNA fragments consisting only of adapter sequence are inserted and sequenced. To get rid of reads containing these sequences, we will use the program `tagdust`. 

For this step, we will need a file containing our adapter sequences.
